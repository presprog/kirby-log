# üìú Monolog for Kirby CMS

This plugin adds the [Monolog logging library](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog) to Kirby.

## ü§üUsage

Use the `monolog()` helper function:

```php
// Write to the default log file
monolog()->log('something happend üò±');

// Log to another channel (only changes the filename for now)
// Will log to "your-log-dir/other-channel-$date.log"
monolog('other-channel')->log('something happend üò±');

// Change the log level (any of \Psr\Log\LogLevel)
monolog()->log('something CRITICAL happend üò±', 'critical');

// ‚Ä¶
```

If you throw and handle exceptions in your own code, you may log them with `site()->logException()`:

```php
try {
    // ..
} catch(\Exception $exception) {
    site()->logException($exception)
}
```

This will log the exception message with `critical` level alongside the stack trace.

The plugin also automatically listens to Kirby `system.exception` hook and logs the exception message as well as the stacktrace to the default log file.

## üíª How to install

**via Composer** (recommended)

```bash
$ composer require presprog/kirby-monolog:^0.1
```

**via ZIP archive**

Download the ZIP archive, extract it into your plugins folder (defaults to `site/plugins`) and rename the subfolder to `monolog`.
